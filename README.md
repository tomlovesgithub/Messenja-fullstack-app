# Messenja-fullstack-app
Modelled off of [similar](https://github.com/tomlovesgithub/messenger_js) [projects](https://github.com/tomlovesgithub/Messenger) i've done in the past, this project was intended as a learning venture into react, and node libraries for fullstack development.
## To run
 - clone/download this repository
 - navigate to this repository in your terminal
 - run `npm i && cd messenja-backend-express npm i && cd messenja-client-react npm i`
 - then `npm start`
 - React should launch the webpage in your default browser for you

## About
Currently still WIP, the React frontend communicates with an express API which feeds a mongoose database.
I used mocha for the first time to test drive the backend for *get*,  *post*, *delete*, and  *update* features. I also used Cypress to configure, and refactor the frontend correctly.

## Current Features
![](imgs/blank.png)
 - Post a message, and have it saved to the database with content, time and unique ID
 ![](imgs/msg.png)
 - Delete individual messsages

   - in progress
     - view individual message
     - Update messages 
     - User Auth
     - Further styling
